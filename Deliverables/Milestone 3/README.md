Milestone 3: 7/30	https://youtu.be/hmUPJRvK82I

This website is going to be designed to pull from a SQL database and present the bills in a readable format for the layman.
Within the webpage it will provide a search bar that allows for the user to look for keywords.  Javascript and .vue will 
pull from the database and filter the results based on the seach keywords.  At the moment, it is a dynamic page and the
back-end database exists, but just requires integration between the front and back.

Current progress.  Java program to update the database is running and functional.  The database is up and running, finally,
there is javascript that can pull data from the database.
