This website is going to be designed to pull from a SQL database and present the bills in a readable format for the layman.
Within the webpage it will provide a search bar that allows for the user to look for keywords.  Javascript and .vue will 
pull from the database and filter the results based on the seach keywords.  At the moment, it is a static page, but the
back-end database exists and just requires integration between the front and back.
