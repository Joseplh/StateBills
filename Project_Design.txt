Project: State Bill Presentation

Goal: Pull bill status from the State Legislature and present it in an easily understandable format.

Purpose: The search function within the state legislature is poor and unless you know what exactly you are looking for, looking for specific bills and actions can become difficult with poor naming schemes, such as "LB1", which is "legislative bill 1" for this cycle.
